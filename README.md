# Assignment Solutions: README

This repository contains Python solutions to various number theory and mathematical programming problems, each implemented as a standalone function. The code is intended for academic and reference purposes.

## Usage

1. Copy the code from `Assignment_Code.txt` into your Python environment.
2. Each function is commented according to its purpose as stated in the assignment.
3. Example usage is provided in the description; you can write your own test cases or integrate into larger programs.
4. No additional dependencies are required beyond Python’s standard library (`math`).
